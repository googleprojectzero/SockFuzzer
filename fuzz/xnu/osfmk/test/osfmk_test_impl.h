 * This function tests the basic allocation and deallocation using kalloc_type.
 * It allocates memory for an integer, performs a simple operation, and then
 * frees the memory. This test is meant to verify the basic functionality of
 * kalloc_type and kfree_type within the XNU environment.
 *
 * @param result Pointer to a TestResult structure to store the test outcomes.
